      <h2>What is PokeML?</h2>
      <p>PokeML is an open-source attempt at creating a community-based image set for all things Pokemon-related!</p>
      <p>These annotated images can them be used for all sorts of Machine Learning applications, to do cool things like visually identify Pokemon, as well as generate new ones as well.</p>
      <p>The key point here is that it's community-based, which is to say that it is run by the community. I believe this is a key part which is currently missing within the Machine Learning community, and is something I would like to explore.</p>
      <p>Which is also to say that you can't build quality image-sets without the help of willing people. People are vital.</p>

      <h2>Why did I start PokeML?</h2>
      <p>My long-term intention is to create an eco-system of free, open-source image-annotation communities, and I thought that Pokemon would be a great place to start.</p>
      <p>It's family-friendly, it's something people love (including myself) and it's something which I believe would be in-demand within the Machine Learning Community.</p>
      <p>The other reason for starting this is that I have a specific set of skills which makes me ideal for doing this sort of thing.</p>
      <p>For starters, I have the technical ability to actually engineer this thing, and furthermore scale it to industrial use. I have software engineering skills that Data Scientists and Machine Learning practitioners typically lack.</p>
      <p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, is that I have strong online-marketing skills. I know how to build online communities and I know how to make them flourish.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, PokeML is a community and that </p>

      <p>Of course, I also love pokemon.</p>

      <p>A few key skills are required in order to make this work.</p>
      <p>I have the technical ability to not only build this platform, but to market it as well. And that </p>
